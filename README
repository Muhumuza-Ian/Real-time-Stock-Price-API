This simple PHP script uses site scraping techniques to get stock price data from online data providers.

Contributors are welcome to fork this project using new source sites and innovative scraping techniques. Any useful code from forked projects which accelerates the real-time data return of this script will be added to each update of this project.

Instructions:

Add this script to your server.

Simply pass in a RESTful GET request to this script with one variable: ticker.
e.g. yoursite.com/index.php?ticker=IBM

You will get a JSON return of the stock price.

If you receive an error, you either sent an invalid ticker symbol or all source sites from this script restructured their sites. You may need to update the PHP script (git@github.com:m140v/Real-time-Stock-Price-API.git) 

Updated sources are welcome.
